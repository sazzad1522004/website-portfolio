            <h1>Adobe Premiere Pro</h1>
            <h3>Experience over 4 years</h3>
            <p>Premiere Pro is the successor to Adobe Premiere and was launched in 2003. Premiere Pro refers to versions released in 2003 and later,whereas Premiere refers to the earlier releases. Premiere was based on ReelTime, a product acquired from SuperMac Technologies Inc. and was one of the first computer-based NLEs (non-linear editing system), with its first release on Mac in 1991. Adobe briefly abandoned the Mac platform after version 6 of Premiere..</p>

            <h3>Experience over 4 years</h3>

Cotter, and Russell Belfer[4] at the Company of Science and Art in Providence, Rhode Island, where the first two versions of the software, 1.0 (January 1993)[5] and 1.1, were released by the company.

Adobe's first new release of After Effects was version 3.0.</p>
